So this is an intro to reverse engineering series. This focuses on taking assembly code, and from it manually generating the source C code.
If this is your first time doing this type of work, I recommend that you watch this video generated by HackUCF.

You will probably have to watch it a few times before it sinks in. I know I had to watch it ten times before I understood it. 

The writeups for this part assume that you have watched the video, and understand the content. If after this series, you still want to do some more reversing work in this wargame you have two options. The first is another series called ctrl_z which is more advanced reversing work. The second is for every other challenge in this wargame, you can just take the elf and reverse it into the original C code.
